        <p><em>Java programmer, data scientist and lawyer</em></p>

        <p>I am seeking to change careers into programming. I have a passion for
          problem-solving, creativity, continuous learning and development and
          excelling in everything I do. This attracted me initially to pursue a
          successful law career for 10 years and I have practised as corporate, tax
          and risk lawyer in the USA, internationally and in the UK at some of the
          biggest and well-known firms. </p>
        <p>I became fascinated with programming and data science through the executive
          education start-up company Sector School, which I co-founded after my law
          career. Since then, I have become both an Oracle Certified Associate and
          Professional in Java (OCA & OCP), have completed the Microsoft Professional
          Programme in Data Science and over 30 courses in web development, Python,
          statistics and mathematics. All my coursework and certifications are listed
          in my profile below. I am actively looking for entry full-time, part-time or
          project opportunities in programming where I can continue to grow
          professionally in these areas and contribute with my knowledge and
          experience.</p>
